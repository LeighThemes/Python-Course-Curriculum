# Python Game Development Curriculum

Created by Leigh Castro Mercado

Course Overview

  This course introduces students to programming through Python and game development.
  Students will learn coding fundamentals, problem-solving, and creative design by building a
  series of interactive games, progressing from simple 2D projects to advanced
  physics-based games with 3D environments. 
  
  Each project emphasizes design, debugging, and
  iteration, with independent coding activities reinforcing conceptual understanding.

Course Structure

  The course is divided into two major parts: Class Coding Lessons and Coding Activities. 
  Class lessons are project-based, spanning approximately three days per module.
  Each module focuses on designing and coding a complete game from scratch while
  emphasizing reusable logic and programming best practices.
  
  Coding activities serve as shorter, focused exercises on specific Python concepts.

  Modules Overview:

  Part 1: Class Coding Lessons
  
    Module 1: Flappy Birds — Learn Python and Pygame basics by building a functional Flappy
    Bird clone. Focus areas include variables, loops, gravity, and event handling.
    
    Module 2: 2D Platformer — Develop a side-scrolling platformer emphasizing physics,
    collisions, and player movement.
    
    Module 3: Geometry Dash — Create a timing-based runner inspired by Geometry Dash with
    procedural obstacles and parallax scrolling.
    
    Module 4: Cookie Clicker — Build a GUI-based clicker game that introduces data
    persistence, upgrades, and counters.
    
    Module 5: Shape Blast — Program a color-matching arcade game with solved and unsolved
    versions to promote problem-solving.
    
    Module 6: Hill Racing — Simulate physics-based driving on hills using trigonometry and
    OOP techniques.
    
    Module 7: 3D Game — Explore 3D rendering principles, including projection, rotation, and
    camera movement.
    
    Module 8: Block Survivor Game — Design a fast-paced survival mini-game emphasizing
    real-time collision detection.
    
    Module 9: Castle Defense — Build a tower defense game with waves of enemies, upgrades,
    and projectile logic.
    
    Module 10: Kart Game — Develop a top-down kart racer with steering physics, AI
    opponents, and race logic.
    
    Module 11: Portal Game — Code a 2D portal puzzle game that integrates teleportation
    mechanics and puzzle design.
  
  Part 2: Coding Activities

    Inheritance Practice: Learn about Python’s class inheritance structure through practical
    examples.
    
    Lists: Practice using lists and loops with number-based exercises.
    
    Planet Lists: Create a solar system application demonstrating list and loop manipulation.
    
    Speed Dots Game: Build a reflex-based mini-game focusing on reaction time and scoring
    systems.
  
  Learning Outcomes:
    Upon completion, students will be able to:
    Write and debug Python programs effectively
    
    Apply object-oriented programming in game development
    
    Create complete 2D and simple 3D games using Pygame
    
    Implement event-driven logic, physics, and interaction
    Approach coding with design-oriented problem-solving skills
  
  Optional Extensions:
    Students may further expand projects by adding menus, animations, or multiplayer features,
    or by converting their games into distributable executables or web applications
